description: a nixpkgs lib that could replace nix-filter
---

In my rust projects I use [nix-filter](https://github.com/numtide/nix-filter) to filter files that are used in nix builds.
This ensures that the build cache isn't invalidated when I change files that are unrelated to it e.g. when editing a `README.md`,
the project does not require a re-compile.

The syntax looks like this:

```nix
src = inputs.nix-filter.lib {
  root = ../.;
  include = [
    "Cargo.lock"
    "Cargo.toml"
    "src"
  ];
};
```

Recently, nixpkgs added [lib.fileset](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/tree/master/lib/fileset)[^1] which, upon first look, appears to be very similar:

```nix
lib.fileset.toSource {
  root = ./.;
  fileset = lib.fileset.unions [
    ./Cargo.lock
    ./Cargo.toml
    ./src
  ];
};
```
