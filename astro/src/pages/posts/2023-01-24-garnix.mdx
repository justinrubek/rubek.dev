description: A look at nix-first CI vs other approaches

?> I'm not writing this assuming readers are seasoned nix users,
however I am also not going to explain nix concepts in depth.
It should be possible to follow along but you may have to do further research.
I have tried to provide links where they are applicable.
If you need an introduction to nix, the single best source I've found is [Nix from First Principles](https://tonyfinn.com/blog/nix-from-first-principles-flake-edition/)

# Overview

I've used GitHub Actions on a lot of projects.
It definitely has a lot going for it:

- It's free
- Almost everything I've worked on has been stored on GitHub, so it's always available and integrates well with the UI
- There is a pretty vast ecosystem of actions that can be used

However, there are also some issues that I think either make it tricky (or at least very tedious):

- There is some concept of caching build artifacts, but in practice I've not seen this work well
    - You can use a [nix binary cache](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Binary_Cache), but this can be slow. I regularly saw a lot of action time be used just to download from the cache
- Limitations on virtualization
    - I had to remove usage of [nixos-generators](https://github.com/nix-community/nixos-generators) for creating an AWS image-- It needed KVM support which was not enabled on the provided runner
- Self-hosted runners, without proper thought, can slow down your pipeline
    - Without a sufficient number of them your jobs will have to wait to be ran
        - As a result, you need some system for scaling these up yourself
    - If you need to access private networks then you'll almost certainly need these
        - Although I am very interested in trying [tailscale's action](https://github.com/tailscale/github-action) to work around this
- Debugging can often result in **A LOT** of trial and error
    - There are tools like [act](https://github.com/nektos/act), but I haven't had much luck. It isn't the same environment and you'll have to set up all the environment variables and secrets yourself. I don't consider it a proper substitute
    - This can result in many, many extra commits and waiting for job completion. If there are other slow-running jobs (such as in a monorepo) then you can wait a really long time to find out your change was incorrect


I don't think Actions is a bad tool, but I definitely have had a lot of my time burnt using it.
In projects that use nix, I think embracing nix tooling is extremely valuable as a time and compute saver.
Let's look at a few different approaches.

# Approaches

I've ran a set of CI checks on the same codebase using a few different strategies.
The codebase is based off of my [template](https://github.com/justinrubek/templates) for rust + [crane](https://github.com/ipetkov/crane).
Crane is really neat in that it separates builds into two steps: first the cargo workspace dependencies are built and only then are the workspace crates built.
The crate being built is just a hello world application.

You can find the code for this post [here](https://github.com/justinrubek/ci-comparison).
The PRs on the repo are where I have tested each approach to compare time.

## naive nix + Actions

This action is simple: it installs nix and runs `nix flake check`.
You can place any packages you need to ensure build in the [flake checks](https://github.com/NixOS/nix/blob/f503ba1b8b5912083a6112e3cf082e3525ba258d/src/nix/flake-check.md), as well as tests, lints, and anything else you can think of.

```yaml filename=.github/workflows/ci.yaml
name: CI
on: push

jobs:
  test:
    name: tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install nix
        uses: cachix/install-nix-action@v15
        with:
          extra_nix_config: |
            access-tokens = github=${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - run: nix flake check
```

However, there is a big problem with this one: it will rebuild everything each time it is ran.
This can result in a huge time increase when building toolchains that won't change between runs.
It's likely that a lot of things you'll need will be in the [default NixOS cache](https://cache.nixos.org/), but certainly not everything.

## nix + Actions + binary cache

Okay, so the easiest next step is to introduce a binary cache.
With a cache, in the best-case scenario `Cargo.lock` will be unchanged so the workspace dependencies will not be rebuilt.
This is similar to how local development with cargo will cache results in the `target` directory-- except it works for CI too.
There are a number of cache solutions out there, but for now we'll focus on [Cachix](https://cachix.org) because:

- At the time of writing, it is free for open source work
- It is a managed service, and onboarding yourself is very fast

I won't delve into them, but it is worth mentioning some other caches (which may be self-hosted):
- [Attic](https://github.com/zhaofengli/attic) 
- [Peerix](https://github.com/cid-chan/peerix)
- [nix-serve](https://github.com/edolstra/nix-serve)
- [nix-serve-ng](https://github.com/aristanetworks/nix-serve-ng)
- roll your own
    - [with s3](https://fzakaria.com/2020/07/16/setting-up-a-nix-s3-binary-cache.html)
    - [with OpenAPI spec](https://fzakaria.com/2021/08/12/a-nix-binary-cache-specification.html)


With Cachix, there is a simple action that you can use which will configure nix to pull from its cache and will upload artifacts at the end of the job. Your action just needs to add a single step:

```diff filename=.github/workflows/ci.yaml
name: CI
on: push

jobs:
  test:
    name: tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install nix
        uses: cachix/install-nix-action@v15
        with:
          extra_nix_config: |
            access-tokens = github=${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

+     - name: Setup nix cache
+       uses: cachix/cachix-action@v10
+       with:
+         name: justinrubek-ci-comparison
+         authToken: "${{ secrets.CACHIX_AUTH_TOKEN }}"

      - run: nix flake check
```

With this setup any subsequent nix commands can pull in already built [derivations](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/language/derivations.html).
As a bonus, the binary cache can be shared with developer machines using [`nix.settings.substituters`](https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=unstable&show=nix.settings.substituters&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=nix.settings.sub) and [`nix.settings.trusted-public-keys`](https://search.nixos.org/options?channel=unstable&show=nix.settings.trusted-public-keys&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=nix.settings.trust) ([or using `nix.conf`](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/unstable/command-ref/conf-file.html#conf-substituters) if not on NixOS).
This means that if CI has ran then it is fairly cheap to pull the build results on other machines.

One drawback is that this is somewhat slow.
Time is saved compared to having no cache, but pulling items from the cache takes longer than you might expect.
I've not (yet) tested if there is a difference on a self-hosted runner, but I imagine there may be. If the runner was on NixOS then I believe there'd be some improvement due to items remaining in the store (although if there were multiple runners then this shouldn't be true). The best case scenario probably involves the cache server being physically nearby the build server. This is certainly something I think would be good to explore more.

## garnix

[Garnix](https://garnix.io) takes a little bit different of an approach.
It embraces nix flakes entirely and builds in an environment with nix already available.
It is provided as a GitHub app that listens for events, then pulls the repo and does its checks.
Garnix requires no configuration; the [flake output schema](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes#Output_schema) is enough for it to determine what it needs to do.
In addition to the checks it provides a binary cache of resuls available which can be configured as a substituter.

!> In the [first approach](#naive-nix--actions) we had to add packages to the flake checks manually, but this is not the case with Garnix.

The process is about as simple as it can get.
If your project ships with a `flake.nix` then all you have to do is enable Garnix on the repository and you're done.
My checks include linting and formatting so basically all of the pieces I need to manage a codebase are accomplished:
the repository is ready for PRs.
The CI time is significantly reduced because Garnix is nix-aware (and has very quick access to its own cache).
I love how quickly this allows me to move when setting up a new repo.

Another major advantage is that Garnix adds each separate build as a check on GitHub's UI.
The author of the PR can easily see what they need to work on.
The previous options don't give GitHub any information about individual steps, so the only
way to figure out what went wrong is to sift through the logs and determine what happened.

![garnix's separate check indicators on the GitHub PR page](/images/uploads/garnix-checks.png)

I've never used this, but you can also use GitHub Action's [check_suite](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows#check_suite) workflow trigger in combination with Garnix to hook Actions back in-- and use Garnix's cache in them.
The [Garnix docs have instructions on doing so](https://garnix.io/docs/gh-actions).

# results

For this workload, Garnix absolutely blows away the other options.
It's hard for me to say how much of that is due to its architecture and that I ran the other approaches on a free CI platform.
It'd be good to run a more complex application and compare some other approaches to see how these change.

| approach | time (rebuilding all) | time (using cache) |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| [naive nix](#naive-nix--actions) | 93s | N/A |
| [cachix](#nix--actions--binary-cache) | 144s | 71s |
| [garnix](#garnix) | 78s | 9s |

# Other comments

I don't think it is a perfect solution, but for many of my use-cases Garnix is perfect.
I save time setting up projects as well as when running the CI.
There is one situation for sure that I think it is not ideal for: private code.
For one, it isn't supported at all by Garnix currently (as far as I understand) but also there is only
a single shared cache provided by Garnix.
In the (unlikely?) case that someone guesses your derivation's path they will be able to retrieve it without any auth.

I think Garnix's model is a great thing.
Even if they don't start offering a paid tier I think it would be well worth an organization implementing something similar.
A lot of the pieces are out there, but it would certainly take some solid work to accomplish.
If they do offer a paid plan then that would probably be the way to go.

I don't currently have the knowledge to discuss these, but they may be worthwhile as things to look into if this interests you.
