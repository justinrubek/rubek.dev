            I'm a developer that likes to focus on building solutions that minimize drawbacks.
            To me this means an obsession for the fine details while optimizing for time of developers and for ease of use.
            I want to build systems that do their job correctly, don't suck to use, and enrich our lives.
            I make it my focus to learn whatever tools I deem required to make this happen and use them to their maximum extent to build first-class solutions.

            While not limited to these subjects, I do a variety of different kinds of work:
            - Automation and computing infrastructure management
            - Web application development (front and backend)

            I primarily work with the following technologies: **Terraform, Nix, Rust, Linux, Docker, AWS, Postgres**

            While not my primary focus, I have a fair bit of experience with **Python, TypeScript, C, C++, GitHub Actions, React, and React Native**

            These days my focus has been on managing cloud infrastructure, automating deployment processes, and streamlining all aspects of development by choosing and configuring solid tooling.
            To that end I have adopted Nix as a key tool in my projects and leverage it as much as possible. I also work a lot from within the HashiCorp stack, with Nomad, Consul, and Vault being among my favorite
            methods to deploy my systems.

            If you'd like to work with me, you can get ahold of me:

            In addition to computing I have a strong passion for cooking.
            It is something that helps me acquire mindfullness and, while seemingly unrelated, this hobby has mutually inspired/been inspired by my software work.
            I'm always looking for new techniques (as well as ways to incorporate technology to improve).
            I called it a hobby above, but really I see it as more of a way of life.
            I am not a cook; I am a human who happens to cook to survive.
            You will see these values reflected in my code: I will prepare the ingredients for my codebase similarly to those of my meals using 
            pre-made ingredients sometimes, but going to the root of the problem and making my own when the benefits are worth it.
            I find this is the key to making something that can truly stand out.
