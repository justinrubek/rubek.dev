## intent-to-add

There may be situations where you need to ensure a file is kept inside a git worktree but do not wish to commit the file when collaborating.

One example this comes up in is when using nix flakes in projects that don't have one and won't accept them as contributions.
In this case, where you'll git to act as if the files were present you can use `git add --intent-to-add` to make it behave as if they were added, but not be included in commits.

!> **specifically, the help page for `--intent-to-add` says:** Record only the fact that the path will be added later. An entry for the path is placed in the index with no content. This is
           useful for, among other things, showing the unstaged content of such files with git diff and committing them with git commit
           -a.
